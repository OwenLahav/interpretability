  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for participating in our study. It has been approved by ethics committee... </br>
    The purpose of the study is the ascertain users' comfort with different machine learning models given various forms of evidence, interpretations, and representations.
  </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <p>
    Please assess your level of comfort utilizing the models described to the best of your ability after each question, and answer the comprehension question at the end of each section.
  </p>

 <div id = 'Rest'></div>
 <div class = 'finished'>
     <h3>Finished!!!</h3>
    <p>
        Thank you very much for taking our quiz. Your anonymous results will be used in a model that shall determine the best evidence to present to potential users of ML models.
